A desktop application with Java programming language – showing true state of the human rights in every country. 
Desktop application will tell a state of human rights (women, children, minorities etc.) in European countries. For the beginning for three countries: 
1. Bosnia and Herzegovina (as a non-EU country, which is in Europe geographically, but is still struggling with the transition and human rights issues, which are not a problem for the western countries anymore), 
2. Germany (as a EU country, which is among the most developed countries in the world presently) and 
3. Russia (as one of the powerful countries from the “east”, which among others, is influencing the modern history and development of the countries around it).

Among issuing human rights in every country, in desktop application the overall political and social statistics for each country will be represented (short introduction, population, short history, government, economy etc.), as well as current issues for every country.
